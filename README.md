Mars Rover Kata, a program to move rovers around the surface of Mars!
Surface of Mars is represented by a Plateau. The Plateau is divided into a grid. A Roverâ€™s position is represented by x and y co-ordinates and the letters N, S, W, E to represent North,
South, West, East. 

Rover has been moved around the surafce using a String of instruction: L R M, where L : turn Left, R: trun right and M: move forward.
